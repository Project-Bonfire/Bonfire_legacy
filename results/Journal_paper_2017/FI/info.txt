These results are generated by using the script:
		
	Bonfire/Scripts/execution_scripts/fault_injection.sh

The results would be accumulated in the output folder in "Bonfire/Scripts/execution_scripts"
However, the fault injection rate should manually be updated in the package file located at:
	
	Bonfire/Scripts/include/package.py

here are the nominal numbers used:

	FAULT_RANDOM_SEED = None        
	HIGH_FAULT_RATE = 1.1
	MEDIUM_FAULT_RATE = 1
	LOW_FAULT_RATE = 0.9

and Fault_Per_Second is: 10000000, 30000000, 50000000, 70000000, 90000000 faults per second
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copy the results into this folder folder names FI_X where X is the fault injection rate. alternatively unzip the following zip file and get all the results in the correct format:
	
	Bonfire/results/Journal_paper_2017/FI/FI.zip

and run the following parser:
	
	Bonfire/results/Journal_paper_2017/FI/parse.py

this will generate the raw parsed data for the experiments.
