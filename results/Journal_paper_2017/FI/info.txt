These results are generated by using the script:
		
		Bonfire/Scripts/execution_scripts/fault_injection.sh

The results would be accumulated in the output folder in "Bonfire/Scripts/execution_scripts"
However, the fault injection rate should manually be updated in the package file located at:
	
		Bonfire/Scripts/include/package.py

here are the nominal numbers used:

	FAULT_RANDOM_SEED = None        
	HIGH_FAULT_RATE = 1.1
	MEDIUM_FAULT_RATE = 1
	LOW_FAULT_RATE = 0.9

and Fault_Per_Second is: 10000000, 30000000, 50000000, 70000000, 90000000 faults per second
